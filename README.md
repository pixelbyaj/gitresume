# gitresume
We offers a hosting service that renders your resume website theme powered by sitePage.js and https://jsonresume.org/ schema

# All you have to do is create a Gist on Github named resume.json.

e.g. https://gist.github.com/pixelbyaj/24db2a845dcbb918b48dc9cae6d750c2

Our hosting service will automatically detect this when you access https://sitepage.org?q={your_github_username}
